program constants

	! There are two types of constants: Literal and Named
	! Literal Constants have a value but no name
	! Named Constans have a value and a name

	! Named constants should be declared at the beginning of a program
	! indicating the name and type, such as:

	real, parameter :: g = 9.81

	! and then used for later calculations



end program constants
